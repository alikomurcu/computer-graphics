## Bunny Crush Game with OpenGL

This is the third assignment of CENG477 Computer Graphics Course.

The game is developed with C++ and OpenGL.

In this game, the game board will be presented with a grid of bunnies, each with a different color.
If there are three or more bunnies of the same color in a row or column, they explode and new
random color bunnies slide in from the top to replace them.

The player can click on bunnies to manually cause them to explode, and the game will keep track of the number of moves the player
has made. 

The playerâ€™s score only be counted for bunnies that are exploded as part of a match.
The goal of the game is to earn as many points as possible by matching as many sets of bunnies as
possible.
